# Low-Priority Defects Resolution Summary

## Newly Implemented Improvements
- Dynamic MongoDB codename detection with fallback mapping and idempotent repo add.
- JSON diagnostics output via `diagnose.sh --json` (single-file summary.json alongside text report).
- Python quickstart modern packaging: always generates `pyproject.toml`; optional skip of legacy `setup.py`.
- Health check resilience: section-level aggregation (no early abort) + summarized section errors.
- Idempotency enhancements: MongoDB repo skip if present; semester archive skips existing tarballs.
- Documentation updates: README, COVERAGE_MATRIX, DEFECTS updated; guide renamed to `GUIDE.md`.

## Partially Addressed
- Idempotency: foundational pieces added; broader package/install skip logic still future work.

## Remaining Future Opportunities
1. Expand idempotency to ML stacks (skip reinstall if torch/tensorflow present with desired version).
2. Per-section JSON segmentation in diagnostics & richer machine-readable health check output.
3. Further distro mapping for MongoDB beyond focal/jammy/noble + Mint variants.
4. Shellcheck autofix pass for any newly introduced minor quoting/style issues.
5. Plugin / modular architecture for course setup scripts (reduce monolith size).
6. Apple Silicon specific ML optimization guidance (Metal / tensorflow-macos).

## Status
All previously categorized low-priority defects addressed or reclassified as future enhancements.
