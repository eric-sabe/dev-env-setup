[![CI](https://github.com/eric-sabe/dev-env-setup/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eric-sabe/dev-env-setup/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Markdown Lint](https://img.shields.io/badge/markdownlint-config-blue)](#)

A comprehensive collection of scripts to set up and manage development environments for college computer science students across macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**First, ensure Git is installed:**

- macOS: `xcode-select --install` (then `git --version`)
- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf install -y git`
- Windows: Install "Git for Windows" from https://git-scm.com/download/win, then restart PowerShell/Terminal.

**Get coding in 5 minutes:**

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eric-sabe/dev-env-setup.git
   cd dev-env-setup
   ```

2. **Make scripts executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh scripts/**/*.sh
   ```

3. **Run platform setup**:
   - **macOS**: `./scripts/setup/macos/setup-mac.sh`

## üìñ Documentation

## üß™ Platform Features (Experimental)
The following components are early-stage and may change or be removed while we refocus on core student setup workflows:

- Archive integrity verification (`scripts/security/verify-archives.sh`) ‚Äì now outputs JSON (`--output-json`) for CI; schema may evolve.
- Prefetch/offline cache (`scripts/cache/prefetch.sh`, `scripts/utils/offline.sh`) ‚Äì experimental; not yet wired into course scripts broadly.
- Operation ledger (`scripts/state/ledger.sh`) ‚Äì append-only audit chain; format may change.
- Rollback stub (`scripts/state/rollback.sh`) ‚Äì limited uninstall support (npm globals, pip groups) ‚Äì interface unstable.
- Structured logging (`scripts/utils/log-json.sh`) ‚Äì initial schema for future metrics.

See `changelog/nextlevel.md` ‚ÄúScope Stabilization‚Äù section for the short list of wrap‚Äëup tasks before advanced phases resume. Treat these as optional; they are not required for normal student usage.


## üß∞ Utilities Overview

Located in `scripts/utils` unless noted:


See `COVERAGE_MATRIX.md` for feature mapping and `DEFECTS.md` for improvement history. Recent additions: JSON diagnostics output, pyproject-only Python project option, dynamic MongoDB repo detection, idempotent semester archiving, resilient health check aggregation.

## ‚úÖ Post-Install Verification

Each major course setup script (`setup-database.sh`, `setup-ml.sh`, `setup-webdev.sh`, `setup-systems.sh`, `setup-mobile.sh`) now performs a standardized verification pass at the end using `scripts/utils/verify.sh`.

What it checks (context-aware, non-fatal where appropriate):

Summary output reports PASS / FAIL counts at the end of each script. Failures do not always abort; they highlight gaps students can fix immediately.

Run a script again after manual fixes‚Äîidempotent guards skip already-installed components while re-verifying.

## üîê Security & Hardening

Recent hardening & quality improvements:

> Strict Mode Policy (v1.0):
> - Archives (manifests.archives) must have concrete `sha256` and `content_length`. CI fails if any are missing.
> - Sources that refer to package managers (type: pypi, npm) are informational and excluded from strict checksum enforcement.
> - For non package-manager sources that point to concrete artifacts, a `sha256` is required.
> - GPG key fingerprints are matched before repository addition (fail-fast on mismatch).

### Checksum Locking Workflow
1. Add new entry in `manifests/versions.yaml` with `sha256: TBD`.
2. Run `scripts/security/lock-sources.sh` (dry-run prints updated manifest). For archives, this will compute and fill hashes; package-manager entries are skipped.
3. Commit updated manifest or use `--write` to apply in place.
4. CI `security-baseline` job enforces strict mode for archives and non package-manager sources.
5. Keep hashes current when bumping versions; use archive verify workflows to catch upstream drift.

`generate-sbom.sh` now emits CycloneDX style component list derived from the manifest (Python + Node globals).

Recommended manual follow-ups (not automated):

## üñ•Ô∏è GPU / ML Setup

`setup-ml.sh` auto-detects NVIDIA GPUs (`nvidia-smi`) and installs GPU variants of TensorFlow / PyTorch when present. Use `--no-gpu` to force CPU-only installs:
```
./scripts/courses/setup-ml.sh --no-gpu
```
CUDA / cuDNN installation steps remain partially manual on some distros (RHEL/CentOS, macOS). The script logs guidance without failing if unsupported.

### Archive Integrity Verification

We track external Eclipse distributions (multi-OS / arch, Java & JEE flavors) inside `manifests/versions.yaml` with both `sha256` and `content_length`.

Scripts:
* `scripts/security/collect-content-lengths.sh` ‚Äì probe and list current Content-Length values.
* `scripts/security/verify-archives.sh` ‚Äì quick (HEAD only) or full (download + hash) verification.
* `scripts/tools/update-eclipse-release.sh` ‚Äì bump Eclipse release, reset hashes/sizes for re-lock.

Usage examples:
```
# Quick (size/header) verify all eclipse entries
bash scripts/security/verify-archives.sh --quick --filter eclipse

# Full verify (downloads + hash) ‚Äì use sparingly / CI manual dispatch
bash scripts/security/verify-archives.sh --filter eclipse

# Bump release (dry-run) from 2025-09 to 2025-12
bash scripts/tools/update-eclipse-release.sh 2025-09 2025-12

# Write changes in-place
bash scripts/tools/update-eclipse-release.sh 2025-09 2025-12 --write
```

### CI

GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/verify-archives.yml`
* On push / PR: runs quick verification (no full downloads) for `eclipse-*` archives.
* Manual dispatch (`workflow_dispatch` with `full=true`): performs full download + hash verification.

Exit codes: build fails on mismatched size or hash, guarding against silent upstream changes or HTML error pages.

### Phase 4: State & Offline (Early)

State tracking, rollback prototypes, and offline reproducibility layer are being introduced:

Components:
* `scripts/state/ledger.sh` ‚Äì append-only JSONL ledger with hash-chained integrity (`record` / `verify`).
* `scripts/state/rollback.sh` ‚Äì preliminary uninstall (npm globals, pip user packages) with safe dry-run design planned.
* `scripts/utils/offline.sh` ‚Äì `fetch_with_cache` + `OFFLINE_MODE=1` gating for networkless replays.
* `scripts/cache/prefetch.sh` ‚Äì pre-download (currently Eclipse archives) into `cache/` by hash.

Ledger usage:
```
# Record an action
bash scripts/state/ledger.sh record --action install_python --component numpy --status ok --duration-ms 3120

# Verify chain integrity
bash scripts/state/ledger.sh verify
```

Prefetch + offline verify:
```
# Populate cache (downloads if missing)
bash scripts/cache/prefetch.sh --filter eclipse

# Run quick verification without network
OFFLINE_MODE=1 bash scripts/security/verify-archives.sh --quick --filter eclipse
```

Conventions:
* Ledger file: `state/ledger.jsonl` (ignored by git).
* Head hash: `state/ledger.head` (verifies tamper-free chain).
* Cache dir: `cache/` (ignored). Future: embed manifest fingerprint to detect stale artifacts.

Planned next (short-term): extend rollback targets (brew leaves, apt groups), generic prefetch manifest walker, parallel size probe in verification, and manifest hash embedding for cache coherency.
